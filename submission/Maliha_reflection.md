# ✍️ Project Reflection

I come from a Finance background, and I am a beginner in programming. I had very limited knowledge of Python, and much of the code was not comprehensible to me. I considered this my chance to learn a complete workflow, rather than just writing code. As I progressed through this assignment, I learned to break the project into manageable steps, and the pieces began to fall into place.  

This project taught me how to turn raw API data into a consistent format and then into readable visuals. Along the way, I practised using AI intentionally. I worked in small steps: first, I provided AI with my exact assignment requirements in my own words. Then, I requested an overall analysis and a rubric-aligned summary. Next, I asked which approach to use foundation, standard or extension option. After AI explained the pros and cons, I chose wttr.in to keep the setup simple. I asked AI to generate code that matches my function names and adheres to a clean data format. 

I gained the most value from prompting AI to assist me in writing, testing, and refining my code. When I encountered confusing errors, I pasted the message, asked what it meant, and received clear, practical fixes. I also used it to brainstorm features and tidy up my functions. Working this way transformed a project that initially felt too complex into clear steps, keeping me moving forward. 

I am most proud of the function that gets the weather. I added checks to prevent errors on invalid inputs. By the end, I am glad that everything clicked into place. The charts were well labelled, and my tests ran smoothly. Seeing the visuals match the test results confirmed that the data fetching, parsing, and menu flow all work together as a complete tool. 

At first, I could not work out why it showed a 3-day forecast. After reading the API docs, I learned that the wttr.in JSON feed only returns up to three days. Another challenge was designing a simple user interface. My first menu had too many options, and the flow was confusing. I cut it down to the essentials only. I ensured that each action provides immediate feedback and that invalid inputs don’t crash the app. Testing with empty or mistyped locations helped me refine the wording and maintain a consistent flow.  

Next time, I would like to challenge myself and take the Extension Option and wire in OpenWeatherMap so I can show a true 5-day forecast. I would also integrate a simple AI recommendations layer that reads the forecast and suggests actions like carrying an umbrella when rain is likely, wearing sunscreen on high-UV days, and taking a jacket if it’s windy. 

Lastly, this assignment changed how I approach coding. Being intentional with AI and better prompts shifted my mindset. Python is now approachable, and I have the confidence to keep learning and take on new challenges.

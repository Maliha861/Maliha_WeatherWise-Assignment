AI Conversation 1– Maliha Haque 
Assignment Guideline 
Tool: ChatGPT 
Date: 29-09-2025 

ME:  I have attached my Assignment. I need to create a weather application called "Weather Advisor” in Python. Can you help me create a step-by-step guideline as to how I could do this? Also, how you should I approach this assignment to make sure I meet requirements of the rubrics? Keeping in mind, that I am still learning programming skills, I am not an expert yet so i need detailed guidelines. 

AI: Awesome—let’s turn “Weather Advisor” into a clear, do-able plan. I’ll give you (1) a step-by-step build guide, (2) a rubric-aligned checklist so you don’t miss marks, and (3) simple templates  

Step-by-step build guide (beginner friendly) 

0) Decide your data source (start simple) 

Use the Foundation option (fetch-my-weather) first so you can focus on your app logic; you can always extend later. Your app must: get weather for a user location, show current + forecast, and create ≥2 visualisations (e.g., temperature trend + precipitation).  

You’ll also build a natural-language interface and a pyinputplus menu.  

1) Create your repo & project skeleton 

Repo: weather-advisor/ 

notebook.ipynb (main Colab notebook) 

README.md (how to run) 

requirements.txt (fetch-my-weather, requests, matplotlib, pyinputplus) 

conversations/ (conversation1.txt … conversation5.txt) 

images/ (saved charts, optional) 

Add a quick README with run steps and a short feature list. 

The instructor expects a GitHub repo and LMS ZIP; include your AI conversation text files and a 300–500 word reflection.  

2) Lay out the notebook sections first (this scores organisation marks) 

Create markdown headings for each required section in this exact order; you’ll fill them as you go: 

Setup & Configuration → imports, install cells 

Weather Data Functions → get_weather_data 

Visualisation Functions → two chart functions 

Natural Language Processing → parse_weather_question 

User Interface → menu with pyinputplus 

Main Application Logic → ties everything together 

Testing & Examples → demo cells & edge cases 
(These section headings are specifically required.)  

Tip: Add a short “What this section does” note under each header. That clarity is graded.  

3) Implement get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5) 

This exact signature will be used by the test harness. Start with Foundation option (fetch-my-weather) and return a clean dict with: 

location (string you queried), 

current (temp, condition, precip), 

forecast (list of days with date, min/max temp, precip probability). 

Testing staff will also mock APIs; handle missing fields and failures gracefully; if you later use OpenWeatherMap, pull the key with os.environ.get("OPENWEATHER_API_KEY") and use requests.  

The core function stubs you must implement are specified here (copy names exactly): get_weather_data, parse_weather_question, generate_weather_response, create_temperature_visualisation, create_precipitation_visualisation.  

Beginner pattern (pseudocode): 

def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5): 
    # 1) call library/API 
    # 2) if error or empty -> return {"error": "..."} 
    # 3) normalise to: { "location": str, "current": {...}, "forecast": [ {...}, ... ] } 
    # 4) slice forecast to forecast_days 
    return data_dict 
 

4) Build two visualisations 

Create two separate functions that accept your processed dict and either display or return a matplotlib figure (match the stub names). Label axes and titles so they’re clear. 

Suggestions: 

create_temperature_visualisation: dates on X, min/max or avg temp on Y (line chart). 

create_precipitation_visualisation: dates on X, chance/amount on Y (bar chart). 
These directly satisfy the “≥2 visualisations” requirement.  

ASSIGNMENT 

5) Add simple natural-language understanding 

Start intentionally small; support a few patterns well: 

Location: “in Perth”, “for Sydney” 

Time: “today”, “tomorrow”, “next 3 days” 

Attribute: “temperature”, “rain”, “wind”, “humidity” 

parse_weather_question(question) → return a dict like: 

{"location": "Perth", "days": 3, "attribute": "rain", "when": "next"} 

If something’s missing, set a default (e.g., user’s last location or ask via menu). 

generate_weather_response(parsed, weather_data) 
Use the parsed intent to compose a friendly sentence: 

e.g., “In Perth, over the next 3 days you can expect light showers with highs ~23°C.” 

These two functions fulfil the Natural Language Interface requirement.  

6) Create the menu with pyinputplus 

A simple looped menu that calls your core functions (don’t duplicate logic in the UI): 

Set/Change location 

Show current conditions 

Show 3–5 day forecast + charts 

“Ask a question” (free-text → parse → respond) 

Exit 

The spec explicitly allows either console menus with pyinputplus or widgets; whichever you choose, your UI should call your core functions.  

7) “Main Application Logic” 

Wire everything up: 

Keep a state = {"location": "Perth", "forecast_days": 5}. 

On each menu choice, call the right function(s) and print a tidy summary. 

Offer to display or save the charts into images/. 

8) Testing & edge cases (have explicit demo cells) 

Make small, visible demos: 

Valid location (“Perth”, 5-day forecast) 

Invalid/typo location → graceful message (no crash) 

Ask “Will it rain tomorrow in Fremantle?” → parsed → sensible answer 
The assignment will test incomplete and error cases; show you handle them.  

9) AI-conversation documentation (big marks here) 

Create ≥5 TXT files (conversations/) that show you using intentional prompting strategies and before/after improvements. These are heavily weighted (45% combined across two rubric rows).  

Also ensure you actually include the TXT files in submission; it’s listed under “Required Files.”  

10) Final tidy-up for submission 

Notebook matches the required section layout.  

ASSIGNMENT 

README explains setup and how to run. 

Push to GitHub, then ZIP the repo for LMS.  

 

ME:  Give me a summary table for all these. 

Here’s a clean summary table of everything we discussed — from setup to final submission — so you can follow it like a roadmap for your “Weather Advisor” assignment 👇

🧑‍💻 Pro Tips (Beginner-Friendly) 

✅ Start with Foundation option (library call) before moving to APIs. 
✅ Write pseudocode for each function before coding. 
✅ Test small pieces individually (fetch → chart → parse → respond). 
✅ Keep AI conversation logs as you go, not at the end. 
✅ Run notebook top-to-bottom before submitting to ensure no errors. 


ME: I want to use the wttr.in API directly (e.g., https://wttr.in/Perth?format=j1) and return JSON weather data. I’m a beginner, so please explain each step clearly. 

AI: 
Sure! The steps are: 
Use the requests library to call the API. 
Parse the JSON response. 
Extract useful fields (current condition, forecast dates, temperature, precipitation). 
Return a clean dictionary so other parts of your program (charts, responses) can use it easily. 
Here’s a first version: 
import requests  
def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5): 
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1" 
    r = requests.get(url) 
    data = r.json() 
    return data 

 

ME: This works but it’s too basic. I want the result to be structured (current weather + forecast) and also handle errors if the location is wrong or the network fails. So what can I do? 

AI: 
Got it! Let’s improve it. You’ll need to: 
Add try/except for network errors. 
Slice the forecast to 5 days. 
Normalise the output into {"location": ..., "current": {...}, "forecast": [...]}. 

ME: ok. Thanks.

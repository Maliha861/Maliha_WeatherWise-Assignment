Me: Why does it not show a five-day forecast?

AI:
Short answer: because your data source (wttr.in JSON) only returns up to 3 days. Your function also intentionally clamps any request to that limit.

What’s happening:

The ?format=j1 endpoint provides a weather array with at most 3 daily entries.

In your code, you cap the request so it can’t exceed what the API returns:

# inside get_weather_data(...)
forecast_days = max(1, min(int(forecast_days), 3))  # 5 -> 3

So even if you call:

wd = get_weather_data("Perth", forecast_days=5, units="m")
len(wd["forecast"])  # will be 3

Your options:

Accept 3 days (most straightforward)

Keep the clamp and label your UI/plots “3-Day Forecast”.

Switch APIs if you truly need 5 days

Use something like OpenWeatherMap’s “5 day / 3 hour” forecast (requires an API key), and adapt your parsing/plots.

Demo-only 5 days

For visuals/tests, you can feed a mock 5-day dictionary to your plotting functions, but note in your report that wttr.in JSON itself is limited to 3 days.

If you stick with wttr.in (recommended for your current build), just keep your notebook wording consistent (e.g., “3-Day Forecast”).

What's the difference if I want to use 5 days forecast instead of 3 days? Can. you tell me what sort of changes i would have to bring?
ChatGPT said:

Short version: with wttr.in’s JSON (?format=j1), you can’t get more than 3 days. To show 5 days you must change your data source (or add a second provider) and adjust a few parts of your code. Here’s exactly what to change.

What changes are needed for a 5-day forecast
1) Data source choice

Keep wttr.in → stays at 3 days. No change possible.

Switch/add another provider that supports ≥5 days. Two common options:

OpenWeatherMap 5-day/3-hour (needs API key).

Open-Meteo daily forecast (no key, free).
Either way, you’ll parse their response and normalise into your existing schema:

{
  "location": "...",
  "current": {...},   # optional if provider doesn’t give current
  "forecast": [
    {"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "min_c": ..., "max_c": ..., "chance_of_rain": ..., "precip_mm": ...},
    ...
  ]
}

2) Function signature and clamp

In your current function you clamp to 3:

forecast_days = max(1, min(int(forecast_days), 3))


Change this to depend on provider:

def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5, units="m", provider="wttr"):
    provider_limit = 3 if provider == "wttr" else 5
    forecast_days = max(1, min(int(forecast_days), provider_limit))

3) Branch request/parse by provider

Keep your existing wttr.in branch for 3 days. Add a second branch for the 5-day provider that aggregates to your schema.

OpenWeatherMap example (outline):

import os, requests
from collections import defaultdict
from datetime import datetime

def _normalise_owm(location, raw, days=5):
    buckets = defaultdict(list)  # date -> list of 3h entries
    for slot in raw.get("list", []):
        dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(slot["dt"])
        day = dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        buckets[day].append(slot)

    daily = []
    for day in sorted(buckets.keys())[:days]:
        slots = buckets[day]
        # temps already °C if you call OWM with units=metric
        max_c = max(s["main"]["temp_max"] for s in slots)
        min_c = min(s["main"]["temp_min"] for s in slots)
        # precip: sum rain["3h"] across slots if present
        precip_mm = 0.0
        for s in slots:
            precip_mm += s.get("rain", {}).get("3h", 0.0) or 0.0
        # chance of rain: use max POP (0..1) across slots
        cor = max((s.get("pop", 0) for s in slots), default=0) * 100

        daily.append({
            "date": day,
            "min_c": round(min_c),
            "max_c": round(max_c),
            "chance_of_rain": int(round(cor)),
            "precip_mm": round(float(precip_mm), 1),
        })

    return {
        "location": location,
        "current": {},        # OWM “forecast” endpoint doesn’t have current; you can leave {} or call their “weather” endpoint
        "forecast": daily
    }

def _fetch_owm(location, days):
    key = os.environ.get("OPENWEATHER_API_KEY")
    if not key:
        return {"error": "Missing OPENWEATHER_API_KEY in environment."}
    try:
        r = requests.get(
            "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast",
            params={"q": location, "appid": key, "units": "metric"},
            timeout=10,
        )
        r.raise_for_status()
        return _normalise_owm(location, r.json(), days=days)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        return {"error": "The weather service took too long to respond. Please try again shortly."}
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        return {"error": "Network connection error while contacting the weather service."}
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        code = getattr(e.response, "status_code", "Unknown")
        return {"error": f"Weather service returned an HTTP error (status {code})."}
    except Exception:
        return {"error": "Unexpected error while fetching or parsing OpenWeatherMap data."}


Then call from your main function:

def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5, units="m", provider="wttr"):
    # …validate location…
    provider_limit = 3 if provider == "wttr" else 5
    forecast_days = max(1, min(int(forecast_days), provider_limit))

    if provider == "wttr":
        # your existing wttr.in code (unchanged)
        return _fetch_wttr(location, forecast_days, units)
    else:
        # new provider path (e.g., OWM)
        return _fetch_owm(location, forecast_days)


(If you prefer Open-Meteo, do a similar branch: request daily temps/precip fields and map to your schema.)

4) NLP clamp and Settings menu

Update your NLP clamp so it allows up to 5 when provider supports it:

days = max(1, min(int(days), 5 if provider != "wttr" else 3))


In your Settings UI, allow user to pick 1–5 only when provider supports it. Otherwise, show 1–3.

5) Visualisations

No code change required—your plotting functions already loop across however many forecast entries exist. They’ll simply render 5 points/bars instead of 3.

6) Tests

Add tests that call get_weather_data("Perth", forecast_days=5, provider="owm") and confirm len(forecast) == 5.

Keep your existing tests for wttr to confirm it still returns up to 3.

TL;DR checklist

Add provider arg to get_weather_data.

Clamp days to provider limit (3 for wttr, 5 for new provider).

Implement a fetch/normalise branch for the 5-day provider (OWM or Open-Meteo).

Allow 1–5 days in NLP/UI only when provider supports it.

Keep the same normalised schema so your charts/UI don’t change.


Me: Can you explain the changes you have made?

AI: Here’s a clear rundown of what changed (and why), mapped to your notebook sections.

1) Weather Data Functions (core change)

What changed

New argument: get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5, units="m", provider="wttr")

Provider-aware clamp:
Before: forecast_days = max(1, min(int(forecast_days), 3))
Now:

provider_limit = 3 if provider == "wttr" else 5
forecast_days = max(1, min(int(forecast_days), provider_limit))


Second data path (optional): kept your existing wttr.in parsing (3-day), and added a second branch (e.g., OpenWeatherMap/Open-Meteo) that can produce 5 daily entries.

Normalisation preserved: regardless of provider, we still return your stable schema:

{
  "location": "...",
  "current": {...},            # may be {} if the provider endpoint lacks current
  "forecast": [
    {"date": "...", "min_c": ..., "max_c": ..., "chance_of_rain": ..., "precip_mm": ...},
    ...
  ]
}

Why

wttr.in’s JSON only provides up to 3 days; to show 5 days you need a provider that actually supplies ≥5 days. The provider flag lets you switch without rewriting the rest of your app.

2) New provider fetch + daily aggregation

What changed

Added a helper (e.g., _fetch_owm(...)) that calls the 5-day API and a normaliser (e.g., _normalise_owm(...)) that:

groups 3-hourly slots by date,

computes max_c/min_c,

sums precip_mm,

derives chance_of_rain (e.g., max POP × 100) per day,

returns exactly your schema.

Why

Your visualisations and UI expect daily min/max/precip/chance. The aggregator converts the provider’s 3-hour data into your daily format, so no changes are needed downstream.

3) Environment variable (only for API-keyed providers)

What changed

For OpenWeatherMap: os.environ.get("OPENWEATHER_API_KEY"). If missing, return a friendly error dict.

Why

Keeps secrets out of the notebook and satisfies the rubric’s requirement for safe key handling.

4) NLP clamp (small adjustment)

What changed

When the user asks for “next N days”, we clamp to the provider limit (3 for wttr, 5 for others) instead of always 3.

Why

So “next 5 days” actually works when you’re on the 5-day provider, and still behaves safely on wttr.in.

5) User Interface (Settings + flow)

What changed

In Settings, allow forecast_days up to provider_limit.

(Optional) Add a provider selector (wttr vs owm/open-meteo).

Everywhere you call get_weather_data(...), pass the chosen provider.

Why

Keeps the UX honest: users can pick 1–5 days only when the data source supports it; otherwise it’s 1–3.

6) Visualisations (no logic change)

What changed

Nothing in the plotting functions. They already read from weather_data["forecast"] and will naturally render 3 or 5 points.

Why

We preserved your schema, so charts “just work” with more days.

7) Tests (add one case)

What changed

Added/updated a test that calls:

get_weather_data("Perth", forecast_days=5, provider="owm")

and checks len(forecast) == 5.

Kept your existing wttr tests to confirm <=3.

Why

Shows both paths behave as expected and handles rubric’s “graceful errors” (e.g., missing API key).

What stays the same

Your error handling style (friendly messages for timeout/connection/HTTP/JSON).
Your normalised keys used by charts and the CLI.
Your main app flow (parse → fetch → respond → visualise).

What you gain

A clean way to support 5 days without breaking your existing 3-day wttr.in flow.
The ability to toggle providers while keeping the rest of the notebook unchanged.
